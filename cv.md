**Please allow me to introduce myself:** 

I'm the man, who thinks that 1969 song reference is an outstanding way to start an introduction.

I'm working as an accountant for 7 years straight, and this is my 3rd attempt to learn to write a code since then (have no achievements to share yet). 

My first childhood memory is wonderful white dandelion. 

I'm lucky and brave, even if sometimes I forget about it.
